# Machine Learning with R

ML Algorithms practice using R with tidymodels

# Using this Repository to learn more about developing models using Tidymodels and other R packages.

#Aim

The main aim of this repository is for me to get to learn a bit more about the following concepts in predictive modelling/Machine Learning:

- ~~PCA Analysis~~
- ~~UMAP Analysis~~
- ~~Text Analysis~~
- ~~Recipes~~
- ~~Support Vector Machine (SVM)~~
- ~~Random Forest~~
- ~~KNN~~
- ~~Regression - Logistical~~
- PLS-DA - Discriminant analysis
- KMeans
- Native Bayes
- XGBoost
